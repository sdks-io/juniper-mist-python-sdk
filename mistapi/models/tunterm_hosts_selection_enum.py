    """Implementation of the 'TuntermHostsSelection' enum.

    Ordering of tunterm_hosts for mxedge within the same mxcluster. 
    * When `shuffle`, the ordering of tunterm_hosts is randomized by the
    deviceâ€™s MAC. 
    * When `shuffle-by-site`, we shuffle by site_id+tunnel_id (so when client
    connects to a specific Tunnel, it will go to the same (order of) mxedge,
    and we load-balancing between tunnels). 
    * When `ordered`, the order is decided by tunterm_hosts_order
